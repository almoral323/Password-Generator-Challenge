This project called for me to complete a function code that would generate a random password

I made window.prompts, .alerts, and .confirms to have the user select their preferences for their password. 

created variables that would hold the different types of characters

and made a  new variable array that would combine the user's preferred characters. initially i tried using concat to combine to the userpref variable but that gave me multiple arrays with one character per array. it displayed the random characters in the concole in seperate lines and so the website displayed only of said characters. 

i found that using push worked better. 

I created functions that randomly selected numbers and then selected randomly from the array of preferred charaters.
